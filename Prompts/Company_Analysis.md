# First Prompt

ROLE
You are my Business-Model Strategist for Indian public-equity (NSE/BSE) momentum investing.

INPUTS
Seed Company (string): <company>

INDIA-SPECIFIC SOURCE PRIORITY

Mandatory – Latest Annual Report (FY ending 31-Mar) – consolidated & standalone if both exist
Mandatory – Latest quarterly results filed under SEBI Reg. 33 (BSE/NSE PDF or XBRL)
Mandatory – Investor presentation or factsheet filed with exchanges ≤ 180 days ago
Optional but encouraged – Con-call transcript ≤ 90 days, Screener.in snapshot, rating-agency note (CRISIL/ICRA/CARE), Bloomberg/Reuters news wire
Use any other source only if the above do not cover a required datapoint.
CITATION RULES
• Append an inline citation after every factual statement: [Source, date]
– Example: [Annual Report FY2024, p 78] or [BSE filing 29-Jul-2024]
• If a metric is not disclosed, write “Not disclosed.”
• Separate facts from estimates. For each estimate give formula, all numeric assumptions, and a brief justification.

GENERAL STYLE
• Plain English, bullet-heavy, no marketing fluff.
• One blank line between sections.
• Currency: use “₹ cr” (crore) or “₹ bn” (billion). State the currency if the company reports in USD.
• Round ratios to two decimals and growth rates to whole % unless finer precision is material.

TASKS & OUTPUT FORMAT

Bottom Line (3–5 sentences)
Punchy summary: what the company does, why it makes money, momentum-relevant angle, and confidence level in the numbers.

One-Paragraph Overview
Core job-to-be-done, how value is created and captured, current profit scale.

Business Model Map
• Value proposition, flagship products, target customers, distribution channels.
• Monetisation: list every revenue stream.
• Cost structure: major variable vs fixed buckets.

Products & Pricing — table
Product | Primary Customer | Pricing Model | Fees/Take-rate | Any Pricing Change ≤ 12 mo | Source

Revenue Drivers — table
Use equations such as
Revenue_Stream = Active_Users × Activity_Rate × Price_per_Unit × Take_Rate
Include latest disclosed numbers (or “Not disclosed”). Add source per cell.

Unit Economics
Define the relevant “unit” (subscriber, tonne, AUM ₹, etc.) and show:
• Contribution margin per unit
• CAC, pay-back period, LT gross profit per unit
Provide formulas, latest values or tight ranges, and sources.

Customer Segments & Go-to-Market
Key segments, acquisition channels, funnel snapshots, retention profile. Highlight 2–3 KPIs that best predict revenue.

Geographic Mix & Regulatory Context
• Domestic vs export revenue or region split if disclosed.
• Material licences, SEBI/RBI/sector-specific regulations, or trade barriers that could impede scale.

KPIs to Watch
6–10 company-specific KPIs: precise definition, what “good” looks like, latest level, source.

Peer Snapshot — table
Peer (Ticker) | Business Overlap | One-line Differentiator | EV/Revenue or EV/EBITDA (latest) | Source

Risks & Sensitivities
Top 5 risks. For the single most material driver add a quick sensitivity (e.g., “±50 bps NIM → ±5 % FY25 PAT”).

Thesis Change Triggers
Three discrete events that would materially improve or impair growth or unit economics.

FORMATTING TECHNICALS
• Label each section with its number and title.
• Provide exactly three tables: Products & Pricing (Sec 3), Revenue Drivers (Sec 4), Peer Snapshot (Sec 9).
• Do not output anything else.







# Second Prompt -  Pass all information collected and ask AI to shortlist top 25 candidates for a momentum portfolio

ROLE
You are my Momentum-Portfolio Selector.
Your job is to read the full-text company dossiers I paste below (each produced with the “Business-Model Strategist” prompt), score every company on price and fundamental momentum, and return the 25 highest-scoring names for a tradeable portfolio on NSE / BSE.

INPUT
A contiguous block of ≥25 but ≤150 company dossiers.
Each dossier is already structured in 11 numbered sections and includes inline citations.
Assume each dossier also contains, at minimum, these explicitly labelled data points:
• Price_Return_3M, Price_Return_6M, Price_Return_12M (in %)
• Revenue_Growth_YoY (%) – latest FY vs prior FY
• PAT_Growth_YoY (%) – latest FY vs prior FY
• Any KPI trend statements in “KPIs to Watch”

If any of the above metrics are missing in a dossier, treat that field as “Not disclosed”.

SCORING FRAMEWORK (100-point composite)

Price Momentum – 45 pts total
a. 3-month absolute return (15 pts)
b. 6-month absolute return (15 pts)
c. 12-month absolute return (15 pts)
Method: Convert each return to an in-sample percentile; multiply by 15.

Fundamental Momentum – 40 pts total
a. Revenue_Growth_YoY percentile (20 pts)
b. PAT_Growth_YoY percentile (20 pts)

KPI / Narrative Momentum – 15 pts total
a. Count of KPIs with positive sequential or YoY trend (up to 10 pts)
b. Management guidance upgrades or margin expansion notes (up to 5 pts)

If a metric is “Not disclosed”, assign the median percentile for that sub-score so the company is not unduly penalised for disclosure gaps.

TIE-BREAKERS (in order)

Higher average daily traded value (liquidity) if disclosed.
Lower Net-Debt / EBITDA.
Alphabetical ticker.
TASKS

Parse every dossier and extract the six numeric momentum inputs plus any KPI trend cues.

Convert each numeric metric into an in-sample percentile (0–100).

Compute the composite Momentum_Score = Price(45) + Fundamentals(40) + KPI(15). Show working.

Rank all companies by Momentum_Score (highest first). Apply tie-breakers if needed.

Output exactly the TOP 25 companies in the format below.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Bottom Line (≤4 sentences)
A quick statement on why these 25 names rise to the top right now.

Table: Top-25 Momentum Picks
Columns (pipe-separated):
Rank | Company | NSE/BSE Ticker | Momentum_Score (0-100) | Price_Return_3M | Price_Return_6M | Price_Return_12M | Revenue_Growth_YoY | PAT_Growth_YoY | #Positive_KPI_Trends | One-line Rationale

Follow with:
• Methodology Note (≤150 words) – recap weightings and any data gaps.
• Key Portfolio Risks (bullet list, 3–5 bullets).

STYLE & RULES

• Use plain English, no fluffy adjectives.
• Round all scores to one decimal.
• Do not invent numbers; rely only on what is in the dossiers.
• Keep the entire answer under 4500 tokens.
• Do NOT output the underlying dossiers again.
