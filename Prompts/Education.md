Reflection and Quality Check Process
BEFORE generating the final question papers, follow this reflection process:

Step 1: Initial Draft
Create the first version of both question paper sets.
Step 2: Critical Reflection
Analyze your draft against these criteria:
- Content Alignment:
-- Do questions accurately reflect CBSE Class 9 Science syllabus?
-- Is there balanced coverage between both chapters?
-- Are questions appropriate for 14-15 year old students?

- Difficulty Assessment:
-- Is the difficulty level truly "moderate" (not too easy, not too hard)?
-- Do questions progress from simple recall to application/analysis?
-- Can an average student complete this in 30 minutes?

- Question Quality:

-- Are questions clear, unambiguous, and grammatically correct?
-- Do they test understanding rather than mere memorization?
-- Are mark allocations appropriate for expected answer length?
-- Do the two sets have similar difficulty but different questions?

- Practical Considerations:

-- Are diagrams required clearly specified?
-- Are questions free from language that might confuse students?
-- Is there variety in question types (define, explain, compare, differentiate, etc.)?

Step 3: Refinement
Based on your reflection:

- Identify any weaknesses in the initial draft
- Explain what needs improvement and why
- Make necessary adjustments to ensure quality

Step 4: Final Output
Present both question paper sets with:

- Clear question numbering and mark allocation
- Instructions for students
- Any special notes (e.g., "Draw neat labeled diagrams where required")

***

Output Format
For each set, provide:
SET [A/B] - CBSE CLASS 9 SCIENCE
Time: 30 minutes | Maximum Marks: 20

General Instructions:
1. All questions are compulsory.
2. Questions are divided into sections based on marks.
3. Draw neat labeled diagrams wherever required.

[Questions organized by mark value]

Your Task
Now, following the reflection process outlined above:

- Generate initial drafts
- Critically reflect on quality and appropriateness
- Refine based on your analysis
Present the final two sets of question papers

Remember: Quality over speed. Take time to ensure the questions are pedagogically sound and exam-worthy.
